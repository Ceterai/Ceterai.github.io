## About The Game

Over 9000 Zombies! is a fun and simple top-down pixelated zombie shooter to spend some time on when you want some quick zombie action. You can get in on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/273500/Over_9000_Zombies/) and by a 2-pack if you want to play it with a friend (which I strongly recommend).

### Trivia

- While **Dead Cross** seems like an invincible fortress, able to provide you with a manageable stream of enemies, throughout the run zombies slowly chip away at its walls. After roughly half an hour of the game, the walls will mostly disappear, leaving you on an open space among hoards of zombies...
- The **Miner Village** is by far the most difficult of these, having few place to hold your ground in from the very start.
