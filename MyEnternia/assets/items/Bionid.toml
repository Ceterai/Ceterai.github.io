Refining it into pure bion and further reinforcing it into a compound makes it a perfect armoring material. Pure bion is not as luminescent, but is very bendable and adaptable.  \nPopular bion compounds and variations include materials like **bionium**, **dianid** or **bionix**.  \nRead more about bionics here: ^#299fc5;Bionics^reset;"
