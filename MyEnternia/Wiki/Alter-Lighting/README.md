# Alter-Lighting ★★★

 **Alter-Lighting ★★★** is a legendary electric whip.

Simple, but powerful energy tool with limited set of functions compensating the sheer power of each crack.  
All pure energy equipment has to have a trade-off to be able to maintain levels of energy this high, devoting a lot of design to proper energy containers and sources.
