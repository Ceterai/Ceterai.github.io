<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/combat.png" alt="Combat Set icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Combat Set** is a rare loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) army soldier, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
This standard combat equipment is designed with a balance between protection and mobility. Additionaly, special life support systems are in place to increase the surviveability as well.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I think I'd be proud to wear this. Although it does feel a little scary. War is bad and can never be justified.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
