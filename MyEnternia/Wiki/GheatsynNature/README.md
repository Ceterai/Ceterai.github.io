<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/gheatsyn.png" alt="Gheatsyn Nature icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> **Gheatsyn Nature** is an uncommon codex entry.

This ebook contains a description of crystallic environments full of "liquid crystals".  
These crystals - gheatsyn - seem to be able to liquefy and crystallize under electric current.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Gheatsyn became an important part of alta tech due to its amazing abilities, so its nature and origins are definitely worth studying.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've found an alta ebook - a collimator electronic reader usually used as a reusable substitute for books. Often crafted in alta datacenters.

### Contents

Beautiful green crystals hang from the ceiling, slowly dripping onto the ground, creating new formations with each crystal drip.

Much like stalactites and stalagmites, gheatsyn crystals grow and shrink, slowly accumulating and spreading in an endless cycle of transformation.

Unlike most ordinary crystals, gheatsyn almost doesn't shine and doesn't shimmer with beautiful reflections, and it is as if some kind of dark mass has accumulated inside it.

This mass - liquid gheatsyn - will instantly harden as soon as it comes into contact with electricity, and the crystal will sparkle with bright colors again.

At such moments, you can safely break it without getting burned by its liquid form.

This is one of the reasons why most alta drilling and mining tools apply a stable voltage level with each strike - harmless to an alta, but enough to affect the entire crystal, or at least a sufficient part of it.

Sometimes such tools have settings that allow you to increase the current, but these should be used with extreme caution.

Gheatsyn grows differently in different conditions. For example, in [gheatorn](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Gheatorn), it is mixed with cave rocks, sometimes becoming noticeably more difficult to extract.

At the same time, gheatsyn growing in gheaprisms is quite fragile, but is very difficult to handle with electricity, since it grows in a rather specific atmosphere, which creates a fairly high resistance to any current.

In any conditions, this extraction is worth it - gheatsyn is an incredibly convenient and flexible material that has a whole variety of uses.

The only pity is that it cannot be used for decoration in its pure form.

It would be unpleasant if your beautiful necklace spilled on you and burned you, simply because electricity got into it.
