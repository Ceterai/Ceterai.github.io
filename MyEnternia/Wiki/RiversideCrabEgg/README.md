Can be used to spawn a crab called riverside crab.  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Tastes well with salad. And also very cute. I am not a bit conflicted on how I should feel about this.

## Parameters

### Critter

Critters can be _relocated_ with a _relocator_, and some of them _drop resources_ when hunted down with a _bow_.  
Look if the critter's shell or outer layer has grow a crystal or bionic matter on it, and remove it carefully to not damage the critter.
