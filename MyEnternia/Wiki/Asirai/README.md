This belongs to Ceterai. How did you get it?  
This mysterious weapon-looking item is actually an energy tool, similar to alta protospears. Ceterai uses it to manipulate energy and help herself travel on long distances.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: ...Ce.. Ceterai?..

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.

## Parameters

### Asirai's Legacy

This tool feels your intent, your tension, and it simply goes along with it. Hold to launch yourself forward.  
Each combo hit of this tool collect energy and releases it in form of electric bursts on the forth combo hit.

### Alternia Discharge

Asirai slowly gathers energy around it, damaging nearby targets, and then releases it back.  
This process creates special energy circulation dynamic that fills the air around you with static.
