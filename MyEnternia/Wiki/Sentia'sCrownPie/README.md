<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/assetMissing.png" alt="Sentia's Crown Pie ★ icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **"Sentia's Crown" Pie ★** is a rare dish.

Full of sweet-sweet hardened [warped honey](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/warpedhoney), enchanting [miko koywa](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/mikokoywa) extracts and [archulin jam](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/archulinjam)-based topping, this pie is basically filled with love! And... something else?...  
It's known that [nivera sentias](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/niverasentias) are often seen baking this interesting dish, and feeding it to unsuspecting altas. Sounds scary...

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I'm not sure if it's right to eat a sentia's cooking. Only if none of them are nearby, I suppose.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
