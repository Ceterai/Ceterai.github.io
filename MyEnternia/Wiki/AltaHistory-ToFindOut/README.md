An important part of alta history. For some reason, it reads like... a fairytale?  
Seems like this is Part 3.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: This is the best part! It's about how we were created!

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've found an alta ebook - a collimator electronic reader usually used as a reusable substitute for books. Often crafted in alta datacenters.

### Contents

Altas were different from Celestia's flowers. They quickly came together and started building, exploring, creating. There were a lot of them, too. Very soon they found ways to make more of themselves, spreading across the world, expanding and doing what they could to help those little flowers.

And as Celestia asked, altas treated them with love and care. The flowers were deeply grateful and all decided to help altas live in peace and prosperity.

And very slowly, the small alta birthplace turned into a magnificent megacity, and their civilization expanded to other planets as well.

While continuing to explore and learn, altas together with Celestia's flowers were having fun, spending time together and enjoying their seemingly meaningless lives.

"Perhaps, this is why I'm here" - one of them thought for a brief moment - "to enjoy this life I have, my Io's gift."

And then that thought dissipated in ceternia, as she went on, smiling towards the sky, knowing that Celestia is somewhere up there, watching her, smiling back.
