# Dreamer Set

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/dreamer.png" alt="Dreamer Set icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Dreamer Set** is a legendary loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) dreamer, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
A set that emphasizes a dreamer's surge of enternia - it supplies you with life energy, making it safer to deal with this much enternia, but also uses it against you targets, making it easier to deal with more aggressive prey.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I don't think all dreamers wear the same specific set of armor, but this seems to be a more or less popular combo regardless.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
