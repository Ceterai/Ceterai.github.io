**WIP**. Be careful - the blade of this spear is made out of poisonous crystals.  
In the hands of a professional, it can become both very useful and quite versatile. Made by [bishyn](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Bishyn) enthusiasts, it has a couple of unfinished features that could unravel its true potential.

Can be upgraded to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_bishyn_spear_2.png" alt="Razhus Az'Ar ★ icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> [Razhus Az'Ar ★](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/RazhusAz'Ar) at the Weapon Upgrade Anvil.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: The handle is so smooth, yet it grips quite nicely too, that's very cool! Not a lot of uses to it though. I know that these are sometimes used to manually carve different weaker crystals, like gheatsyn, but I don't think I plan on doing anything like that.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
