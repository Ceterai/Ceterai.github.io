Transforms an area of a planet into a riverside beach. An alta attempt at creating smaller-scale terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs.  
This steppe area is riddled with rivers and underground waters and thus has rich vegetation that you would commonly find in places like these, like thickets of reeds and willow-like trees. [Altas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) use this coastal zone for resorts and camping, using the reeds as crafting materials for tents and deck chairs. Underneath the ground you can find many different semi-flooded caves with crystal-clear water and interesting rock formations.

This place is a home to brightly-colored [verriskoywa](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/verriskoywa) flowers, these swampy plains are full of tall grass and willow-like trees called [gianas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/gianas).  
Professional chefs often come here in search of a rare spice - [veraltai](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/veraltai), made from petals of [koywa altos](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/koywaaltos).

Under the ground there are harmless moonrock stalactites with water from the rivers slowly dripping onto just as harmless moonrock stalagmites, forming dense electrified ponds right under the surface.
