# Alta Weaponry

All weapons added by this mod have extended mechanics and additional functionality.

## Mechanics

Below is the list of all new mechanics that weapons can have in this mod. If you're a modder and like these features - here's some documentation on the scripts in use: [Modding: Weapons](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/ModdingItems#weapons)

### Press & Hold

Most weapons can do different things if you press and if you hold a button. This means that a 1-handed weapon can do 2 different things, and a 2-handed can do at least 4.

### Item Bonus

Having a certain amount of items in your inventory can increase damage or decrease energy required for a specific attack of a weapon.

### Ranged Mechanics

#### Firemodes

Some weapons (mostly [rifles](#rifles)) can have different firemodes that you can **switch between** using the alt ability.

#### Attachments

Many weapons in this mod have special attachments, or acquire them after an [upgrade](#upgrades).  
Some weapons, mostly [rifles](#rifles), are able to **switch** between multiple attacments using the alt ability.

### Melee Mechanics

#### Combo Attacks

Most melee weapons in the mod have a series of attacks as their primary press mechanic. Each attack can deal different amounts of damage, have different element, apply effects, etc.

#### Charged Hits

Some melee weapons count how much hits you made, and might give you bonus damage/projectiles every x hits/seconds.

#### Melee Abilities

Most melee weapons have a hold ability in addition to alt abilities. These abilities are mostly similar to original SB ones.

##### Downstab

A simple attack that will make the player fall directly down, while dealing damage. Can only be triggered in air and is often paired with ground-only abilities.

##### Blade Charge

Charges the weapon for a more powerful attack with additional effects. Paired with Downstab.

##### Rising Slash

A melee attack that launches the player vertically into the air, dealing damage in the process. Paired with Downstab.

##### Trail Dash

An attack that pushes you forward, leaving a trail behind.

##### Spin Slash

A spinning attack that quickly rotates you, rapidly damaging targets on both sides.

##### Super Spin Slash

An improved version of the Spin Slash, that slightly raises you into the air along with the spinning.

### Upgrades

All weapons under level 6 can be upgraded at a ('[Weapon Upgrade Anvil](https://starbounder.org/Weapon_Upgrade_Anvil)', ['https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/3/38/Weapon_Upgrade_Anvil.png', 'icon', 12, 9]).

This works for [shields](#shields) as well, and even for some [armor pieces](#armor).
