Transforms an area of a planet into alterash gardens. _Use the alta scanner for more info._  
An alta attempt at creating smaller-scale terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs, and has a long way to go.

[Alterash Gardens](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterashGardens) are a peaceful prairie on the surface of Alterash planets, filled with grass, colorful flowers and iridescent [prisms](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Prism) made of crystallized <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust). Rare ayaka trees are scattered around the surface, with ripe bright blue ayas hanging among their leaves.  
The underground here is filled with bushes and rare ayaka roots.

You can find these gardens on every [alterash](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alterash) planet and is likely the first thing you'll see - this mostly plain terrain with little danger around is a great place for landing.

What awaits you in the distance? What lies beneath the surface? What hides up high behind those clouds? Time to find out! _Welcome to Alterash._
