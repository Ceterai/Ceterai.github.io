<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/arco.png" alt="Enviro Set icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Enviro Set** is a rare loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) A.R.C.O. researcher, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
Although this set was designed by A.R.C.O. primarily for usage by their own personel, it's commonly used by alta researchers everywhere due to its impressive characteristics.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I can feel like a researcher in a full-body suit with this! I hope I can swim in it too.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
