# Graa Venetto

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/assetMissing.png" alt="Graa Venetto icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Graa Venetto** is a legendary dish.

A pleasant dish with a layered cake-like mixture with [yukva](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/yukva) cream and [koywa bread](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/koywabread), with roasted [archulin](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/archulin) paste base.  
This complicated dish smells similar to roasted vegetables. The cake part is meant to be eaten together with paste, dipped in it slightly.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Never knew how some chefs are able to make something like this. Truly incredible.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
