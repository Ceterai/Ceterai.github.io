# Alta CORD

**Alta Comprehensive Ontological Reality Database** (CORD) is the foundational worldbuilding database that defines the very fabric of alta civilization's reality. Stored in **/.meta/world.json**, it serves as the ultimate reference for alta culture, language, and existence itself.

**Database Contents:**

- **Alkey Language System** - Complete linguistic definitions, translations, and etymologies
- **Color Coding Standards** - Official palette system for species, factions, and energy types
- **Lore Terms & Concepts** - Canonical definitions for all alta worldbuilding elements
- **System Abbreviations** - Registry of all alta organizational systems (UIKA, BGMR2, XSEM, etc.)
- **Proper Names** - Characters, locations, factions, and historical figures
- **Energy Classifications** - Ceternia, Alternia, Enternia, and Stardust definitions

**Meta-Nature:**

CORD is unique among alta systems as it exists on both narrative and meta levels - it's simultaneously:

- An in-universe database that alta researchers reference for canonical knowledge
- The actual source code file that defines the mod's worldbuilding foundations
- The "truth" that all other systems (UIKA, XSEM, datacenter records) derive from

As the most fundamental alta knowledge system, CORD ensures consistency across all documentation, in-game text, wiki pages, and lore elements. It is quite literally the ontological foundation of alta reality - both within their world and within the mod's development structure.
