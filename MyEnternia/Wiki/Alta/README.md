## Description

Altas are primarily found on <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [alterash](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alterash) planets and their [subtypes](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alterash#difficulty). Due to their partial [resistance to electricity](#in-game-stats), altas mainly reside on planets with highly ionized atmospheres - this allows them to avoid unwanted conflicts with other species and conduct their research in peace and privacy.

Unfortunately, a failed series of experiments that led to the creation of [kaiters](#kaiter) and other threats caused altas to invest in the development of combat and security technology. In some cases, this led to relocating numerous laboratories and entire facilities away from planetary surfaces, often into underground <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_prime_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [esetera](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterashPrime#esetera) spaces.

Most alta research is based on studying <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) and the types of energy it provides - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/damage/ct_impulse.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [ceternia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Ceternia) (thoughts), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/damage/ct_plasma.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [alternia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alternia) (memories), and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/damage/ct_ionic.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [enternia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Enternia) (dreams). Alternia is the most common energy source on alterash planets and the most balanced in terms of power and safety. Altas often use alternia energy as their main source of electricity and power (see [Alta Technology](#technology)).

## Identity

<details markdown="1"><summary>How to use the term "alta" in english sentences (Click to expand)</summary>

- **Singular:** alta
- **Plural:** altas
- **Possessive:** alta's
- **Contraction:** alta's
- **Plural Possessive:** altas'
- **Adjective:** alta

</details>

### Appearance

Altas are humanoid in form with distinctive pale skin tones ranging from rare light peach to common cool gray-white. They possess a unique bionic nature - bion and plasma-based artificial beings with biological components, making them fundamentally different from purely robotic species like the glitch.

Their appearance is characterized by:

- **Pale skin tones** in peachy-whites and gray-whites
- **Varied hair colors** including dark blues, grays, light blues, pinks, and whites
- **Relatively short stature** compared to average humans

The "light and simple" **arcolar** architectural and design style is considered the main aesthetic for all governmental infrastructure, extending to furniture, clothing, and technology casings.

### Birth and Aging

All altas are grown in special big flowers inside [Elin Gardens](#elin-gardens) via Elin's blueprints. They come out fully developed with preset knowledge and skills, and do not age in the traditional sense.

### Language

<details markdown="1"><summary>What is Alkey? (Click to expand)</summary>

> Source: [Alkey Vocabulary](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/tree/main/.meta/world.json)

Altas speak **Alkey**, a constructed language that serves as the primary communication system for their civilization. The language is deeply integrated into alta culture and technology, with most items, locations, and concepts having alkey names or translations.

**Key Language Features:**

- Consonant-based root system (each consonant carries meaning)
- Vowel modifications for semantic nuance
- Compound word formation for complex concepts
- Simple words with fewer synonyms

**Common Alkey Words:**

- **Alta** - the species name itself
- **Arci** - science
- **Aya** - a common produce item
- **Nia** - energy
- **Staris** - stardust
- **Yaara** - vital grove plants full of ceternia

The language reflects alta priorities and worldview, with extensive vocabulary for technology, research, crystals, and energy concepts.

</details>

### Diet

Altas are herbivores (plant-based diet) and also eat some crystals and insects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>CAN eat (Click to expand)</summary>

- Plants, fruits, vegetables
- Insects (larvae, bugs)
- Chocolate (plant-based!)
- Mushrooms
- Seaweed
- Crystals (certain edible types)
- Milk (plant-based alternatives, like <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_tonna.png" alt="Tonna icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [tonna](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tonna) or [cocola](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/CocolaSeed), human variants like almond or oat milk are also edible though unusual)

</details>

## Subspecies

Alta subspecies fall into two categories: **artificial subspecies** created through intentional design, and **anomalous subtypes** resulting from exposure to dangerous phenomena.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Artificial Subspecies (Click to expand)</summary>

Distinct subspecies have emerged through alta biological engineering and adaptation:

### Altaya

The most common alta subspecies, comprising **99%** of the population. Created from the **Elin blueprint**, altayas are the standard template for alta bionicas and the baseline for all other artificial subspecies.

### Altari

A taller subspecies specifically designed for guardian and protector roles. Altaris are physically stronger and more imposing than altayas, making them ideal for security positions. The capital city **Alliana** is named after the first altari alta.

### Alter

An experimental subspecies created through advanced genetic modifications. Alters represent ongoing alta research into bionica enhancement and specialized capabilities. Their exact characteristics and purpose remain subjects of continued study.

### Kaiter

Originally meant to be alters, they escaped alta control and became a separate, mostly hostile faction. Designed for harsh, cold environments, kaiters possess enhanced resistance to low temperatures. The **Project Kaiter** that created them is considered one of alta civilization's major failures. (See **History** section)

#### Kaitera

Failed kaiter attempts to convert altayas into "corrupted" altayas. These individuals exist in a transitional state, exhibiting some visual characteristics of kaiters but mentally still altayas.

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Anomalous Subtypes (Click to expand)</summary>

These are altas who have been affected by dangerous anomalies or phenomena, resulting in transformation into husk-like states:

#### Enta (Entalta)

An alta whose mind was captured by the dream anomaly of **enterash** planets. The alta becomes a husk, their consciousness trapped in the dream realm.

#### Voida (Voidalta)

An alta whose emotions were captured by the void. These husks have lost their emotional capacity to the void's influence.

#### Heva (Hevalta)

An alta "zombie" who fell sick to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/stats/effects/ct_hevikai.png" alt="Hevikai icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [hevikai](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Hevikai) and was overgrown with [hevika crystals](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterniaCrystal). These unfortunate altas are overtaken by crystalline growth, losing their original consciousness.

#### Vionika (Vionalta)

An alta affected by a viona anomaly, resulting in physical and (possibly) mental transformations. These "enchanted girls" are just trying to learn to live with their newly acquired features, like ears, or fluff, or tails, etc.

</details>

## History

Altas share their lore and history mainly through [codex entries](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/CodexEntries) and enhanced item descriptions accessible via the [Alta Scanner](#alta-scanner).

For a brief retelling of how altas came to be, check out the **Alta History** series of codexes:

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/basic.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta History I](AltaHistory-FromASpeck)
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/security.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta History II](AltaHistory-BornWithAPurpose)
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/lab.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta History III](AltaHistory-ToFindOut)
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/ship.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta History IV](AltaHistory-WhatWeAre)

These codex entries can be found in random alta pods of specific tiers: Alta History I in tier 4 pods, II in tier 3 pods, III in tier 2 pods, and IV in tier 1 pods.

### Origins

> See also: [Philosophy](#philosophy) section for philosophical context

Altas were created by the **fallen** (starborn beings) to research the nature of **stardust**. Since the fallen couldn't reproduce naturally, creating altas allowed them to increase research speed and gain protection while pursuing their understanding of cosmic energy.

## Culture

Alta culture is based around **research**, **entertainment** and **healthy lifestyle**. Due to the fine-grained craftsmanship of their brains and artificially altered perception, there are almost no conflicts in their society - though this has led to cultural stagnation and conservation.

### Crystals

The lives of altas revolve heavily around <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/3/31/Crystal.png" alt="Crystal icon" loading="lazy" width="12px" height="16px"> [crystals](https://starbounder.org/Crystal):

- Altas were created with help of stardust, an inherently crystallic material
- Crystals are abundant resources available in all shapes and sizes on alterash planets

There's a codex entry describing this connection in depth: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/lab.png" alt="Altas & Crystals icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Altas & Crystals](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Altas&Crystals)

**Important Crystal Types:**

- **Cal (Clear Crystal)** - Basic crystallic material
- **Gheatsyn (Green Crystal)** - Used in cuisine and energy applications (see [Calin Cuisine](#calin-cuisine))
- **Hevika (Blue Crystal)** - Advanced research and marine applications
- **Bishyn (Cyan Crystal)** - Decorative and office design, when refined from poison

Alta technology heavily utilizes crystals for energy conduction, data storage (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/alta/datamass.png" alt="Datamass icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [datamasses](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Datamass)), and structural components. The term <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/alta/calotronics.png" alt="Calotronics icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [calotronics](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Calotronics) refers to crystal-based electronics - the alta equivalent of silicon technology (see **Technology** section below).

</p>

### Fashion

Alta fashion mainly uses the **arcolar** style - light, simple, and functional designs that reflect the the clean and technologically advanced alta aesthetic. While fashion is considered a relatively small industry in alta culture compared to entertainment and research, it still plays an important role in self-expression and social identity.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Arcolar Overview (Click to expand)</summary>

**Common Clothing Categories:**

- [Alta Artist](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/ArtisticCrop-Top) - Casual creative wear for artistic and entertainment pursuits
- [Alta Official](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/OfficialJacket) - Governmental and formal attire for official functions
- [Alta Casual](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/LightShirt) - Everyday comfortable wear for daily activities
- [Alta Service](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/ServiceJacket) - Professional uniforms for commercial and service roles
- [Alta Social](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/SocialWorkerTop) - Simple outfits for social work

**Fashion Industry:**

Fashion trends are most often formed in alta capitals like **Alliana**, where popular modeling and entertainment companies are based. Notable fashion companies include:

- [Perizhad](#perizhad) - Leading alta fashion company

**Cultural Notes:**

Due to the FHC (First Human Contact) operation, many "Earth fans" among altas wear human clothing, though it's not very distinguishable from alta fashion due to similar aesthetic preferences. The influence of human fashion created a cultural divide - some altas embraced Earth styles enthusiastically while others view it as cultural contamination.

**Materials:**

Alta clothing often incorporates various <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/alta/bion.png" alt="Bion Compound icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [bion compounds](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/BionCompound) as protective materials. These sturdy materials can be used for both casual clothing and protective armor plating. See the [Materials](#materials) section for details on bion compounds.

**Design Philosophy:**

The Arcolar style prioritizes:

- Simplicity and clean lines
- Functionality over ornamentation
- Light, breathable materials
- Integration with technology (pockets for <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/alta/datamass.png" alt="Datamass icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [datamasses](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Datamass), energy cell charging)
- Adaptability to ionized atmospheres

</details>

### Food

Alta cuisine consists of mostly plant-based meals made from fruits, crops, crystals, bugs, and spices found on alterash planets. Although limited in ingredient choice, altas have created a vast number of recipes with great variety in flavors and aesthetics.

There are four main **cuisines** that are prominent among altas.  
Mostly dependant on the choice of ingredients, dishes of the same cuisine often have similar effects.  
All alta cuisine is regulated by the [Alta BGMR2 System](#alta-bgmr2-system) to ensure quality and consistency.  
Almost all level 4+ food has a **Perfect Variant** achieved via [Perfect Cooking](#perfect-cooking).  
In game, alta food has a wider and more granular range of ferment time descriptions compared to vanilla items.

#### Runeva Cuisine

## Calendar

Since altas use the hexadecimal numbering system, their interplanetary calendar depends on base-16 time divisions.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Alta Timekeeping (Click to expand)</summary>

- **1 Era** = 16 Alectas
- **1 Alecta** = 4 Quarters (Years)
- **1 Quarter** = 4 Seasons
- **1 Season** = 32 Weeks
- **1 Week** = 4 Cycles (Days)
- **1 Day** = 16 Hours
- **1 Hour** = 256 Minutes
- **1 Minute** = 16 Seconds

Local calendars on alterash planets may vary based on planetary rotation and orbit, but the interplanetary calendar remains standardized for alta society.

Date format examples:

- **Feya's Era, Alecta 15 "Irrana", 1st Quarter, Season 1, Week 4/32, Day 1/4** = `Feya 15-1/4/1`
- **Lann's Era, Alecta 11 "Cromin", 2nd Quarter, Season 3, Week 7/32, Day 3/4** = `Lann 11-2/71/3`
- **Lann's Era, Alecta 15 "Irrana", 4th Quarter, Season 2, Week 1/32, Day 1/4** = `Lann 15-4/33/1`
- **Lann's Era, Alecta 10 "Faress", 1th Quarter, Season 1, Week 1/32, Day 1/4** = `Lann 10-1/1/1`

</details>

### Holidays

Altas observe four major holidays that reflect different aspects of their culture - from spooky seasonal celebrations to national pride and gift-giving traditions. Each holiday brings its own unique customs, decorations, and festive atmosphere to alta cities.

These holidays can be planetary and interplanetary, determined by whether they are dependent on local seasons or celebrated according to the interplanetary calendar.

#### [Ceternity](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Ceternity)

> Main page: [The Hallowing Ceternity](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Ceternity)

**The Hallowing Ceternity**, also known as The Spooky Season, is the alta equivalent of Halloween - a spooky-themed celebration featuring costumes, carved fruit lanterns, and festive decorations. The holiday revolves around **Ceternity**, a mysterious being whose abstract, colorful face appears on posters and decorations throughout alta cities.

#### Eseria

This is a small interplanetary holiday where altas choose a day of complete relaxation, that they can spend in a calm and healing atmosphere.

#### [Sona's Veil](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Sonaveil)
