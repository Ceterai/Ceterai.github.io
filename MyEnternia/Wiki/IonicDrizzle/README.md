# Ionic Drizzle

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/cockpit/weather/ct_ionic_drizzle.png" alt="Ionic Drizzle icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> **Ionic Drizzle** is a special [weather condition](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Weather).

Just a little drizzle with a little zap to it. Mostly harmless.  
Can still make you wet, so take that into account. This type of wheather is pretty common and can do more good than harm by watering crops.  
Alta: Love it when it's raining, but the sun is still shining too! Very pleasant. Ionic drizzles are pretty warm, too, so wouldn't mind standing under one just because.

## Parameters
