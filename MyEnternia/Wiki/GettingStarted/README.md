# Getting Started

To get yourself into the content added by My Enternia, you can either fly straight to any alterash planet and explore it on your own, or buy a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/basic.png" alt="Guide to My Enternia icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Guide](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/GuidetoMyEnternia) at [Treasured Trophies](https://starbounder.org/Treasured_Trophies) (if you have them) at the [Outpost](https://starbounder.org/Outpost) to help you with progressing through the mod content more gradually.

In both cases, playing through the mod includes not only **exploration**, but also **crafting** - to access ME progression at all, you'll need to craft an <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/crafting_station/icon1.png" alt="Alta Crafting Station icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Crafting Station](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaCraftingStation), found in level 2 [Inventor's Table](https://starbounder.org/Inventor%27s_Table).

Finally, other crafting tables (as of right now) can be crafted from the Alta Crafting Station as well - just keep upgrading the station to unlock more side stations, like <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/constructor/icon1.png" alt="Alta Constructor icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Constructor](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaConstructor) for objects, wires and decor, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/upgrade_station/icon1.png" alt="Alta Upgrade Station icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Upgrade Station](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaUpgradeStation) for improving certain items using gheatsyn, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/datacenter/icon.png" alt="Alta Datacenter icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Datacenter](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaDatacenter) to be able to craft discovered codex items, and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/dendrarium/icon.png" alt="Alta Dendrarium icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Dendrarium](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaDendrarium) for working with all things plant-related.

## Exploration

- You can start exploring by visiting a couple of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [alterash](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alterash) planets and going through their **surfaces**.
- Then, try exploring **subsurface** and **shallow caves**.
- After you hit a big **drop**, you'll want to try and find a way to get to the bottom of it, and start exploring the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [second surface](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alterash#antorash) of these planets.
- Finally, you should also try digging even deeper and exploring the **core biomes** of alterash planets.
- Next, try exploring the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/biome/ct_eva_loot.png" alt="Evostaris icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [sky](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Evostaris) above the surface - you might find several **clouds**, hopefully with loot on them!
- From there, continue going up until you reach the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/biome/ct_astera_loot.png" alt="Astera icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [asteroids](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Astera), as they also tend to have some useful loot.
- You have explored an alterash planet! But the journey doesn't end there - next up are <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_prime_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [alterash prime](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterashPrime) planets.
- After exploring their **surface**, go down like usual, but be careful - the **drop** starts much earlier, and will have an **intermediate level** filled with island-like rock formations - make sure to not miss them and explore the **second surface** of alterash prime - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_prime_planet.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Esetera](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterashPrime#esetera).
- When you're done, fall off these islands to the **depths** of the planet - the **third surface**.
- Finally, dig into the ground to reach **new core biomes** to explore.
- Same as with alterash, try going up to **asteroids** (no clouds here) for useful materials.

That's basically it!
