<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/shield.png" alt="Shieldrone ★★★ icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Shieldrone ★★★** is an uncommon cryogenic throwable item.

This drone model may not put up a fight, but it will definitely put up a shield.  
Being one of the first drone models with an integrated energy shield, this drone is considered a staple of alta technology.
