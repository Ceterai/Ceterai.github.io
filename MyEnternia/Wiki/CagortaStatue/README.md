A large model of Cagorta - a planet that has always seen success in attracting tourists. Many that got to visit it note its peaceful forests. Three satellites follow this planet, dancing in circles around it, taking turns, one after another.  
The miniature was made using polymeric materials of unknown origin. The surface temperature of the model varies slightly, decreasing with distance from the equator:

- Equator is 43 degrees Celsius;
- North and south poles: -32 and -33 degrees Celsius respectively.

_ANOMALY DETECTED_: Each of the 3 satellites has been discovered to be filled with an unknown unstable reagent.

_WARNING_: Do not, under any circumstances, excavate the satellites in order to obtain the reagent.

- Alta: The Cagorta-1 incident is a great telltale of caution, something Hevika or Neiteru could learn from greatly...
- Apex: Another planet, another alta disaster. Can't believe they could infiltrate the Miniknog with this level of misfortune.
- Avian: A tiny planet on a pedestal!
- Floran: A sssmall world. Not enough Floran.
- Glitch: Interested. I wonder what happens if you open up the satellites.
- Human: I think that is Cagorta - a great tourist destination. Though I've heard it kinda fell off for some reason...
- Hylotl: An unknown ocean planet. Though it feels quite important.
- Novakid: Wonderin' how this here planet floats in the air.
