A large model of Cagorta - a planet that has always seen success in attracting tourists.Many creatures that got to visit it note its peaceful forests. Three satellites are following this planet, dancing in a circle around it, taking turns, one after another.  
The miniature was made using polymeric materials of unknown origin. The surface temperature of the model varies slightly, decreasing with distance from the equator:

- Equator is 43 degrees Celsius;
- North and south poles: -32 and -33 degrees Celsius respectively.

_ANOMALY DETECTED_: Each of the 3 satellites has been discovered to be filled with an unknown unstable reagent.

_WARNING_: Do not, under any circumstances, excavate the satellites in order to obtain the reagent.
