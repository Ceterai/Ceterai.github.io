<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/gyera.png" alt="Alta Botanics Guide ★ icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> **Alta Botanics Guide ★** is a rare codex entry.

This guide describes main objectives of working with plants and is designed to help inexperienced altas learn how plants work! _(Unlocks tier 2 recipes)_  
Mainly, the guide goes over types of Io flora, such as ionic plants, crystallic plants, toxic plants, bionic plants, mushrooms and corals.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Useful when trying to master dendrarium.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've found an alta ebook - a collimator electronic reader usually used as a reusable substitute for books. Often crafted in alta datacenters.

### Contents

Just like mobile creatures, categorized as fauna, flora, or plants, also need certain prerequisites to stay healthy, live longer and perform better at various physical and chemical prospects.

This guide is meant to quickly start you on more complicated side of dealing with wild and domesticated plants, different plant types, fertilizers and how to use them.

Plant Types

The lifeforms covered by alta botanics can be divided into following family groups:

- Herbal Plants
- Aquatic Herbal Plants
- Crystal Plants
- Plant-like Crystals
- Bubble Plants
- Corals
- Bionicas
- Arics or Mushrooms

As you would expect, different plant types generally prefer different groups of minerals, cosmic specks and soil bases to prosper. This is why you might end up using a fertilizer at some point - to provide your plant with additional things you wouldn't usually just find in the ground or liquid the plant is growing in. This is also the case for symbiotic plants.

Fertilizers

Mineral, speck and vitamin mixtures, that can saturate plants, causing them to prosper, sometimes changing or growing beyond their usual limits.
Fertilizers are often considered enhancers for plants for this reason.

While there are general fertilizers fit for most plants, they aren't as efficient as more plant-type specific ones, often manufactured with a small set of plants in mind. These 2 types are called Generic Iora Enhancers and Special Iora Enhancers accordingly.
There's also a third group called Concentrated Iora Enhancers, which are used for targeted boosting of plant's growth and fertility rates short-term.

Soil Types

As expected, the majority of plants found on alterash planets are used to the most common soils on there - such as moon stone, being a good middle ground between dirt and clay, and moon rocks, that are low on density enough for most plants to squeeze between them. There's also moon dust, which is perfect for riverside plants, especially ferns and reeds.

Clay is a much more rare material, often only found in flooded caves on alterash planets, somewhere underneath the riverbends. Close to the core of these planets a different type of materials can be found - Dense Soils, like Compressed Moonrock and Obsidian. These, unfortunately, cannot be used as plant soil as they are too dense for most plants to grow through.

Seed Altering

Whether it is genetic modification, direct mutation or breeding, seed altering is a scientific approach to increasing the plants performance, as well as developing new types of produce, and even plants. These plants can later be introduced into the wild nature, expanding it and adding to its variety.

Advanced Floral Enhancement Appliances and Applications, or Advanced Alta FEA, are pieces of technology aimed at further power boosts and advancements that are physically able to fit in a plant. These should only be used in secure environments as they might often lead to unforeseen consequences.

Altaponic Techniques

These are approaches used by altas to grow various types of plants, as flexible solutions to the problem of finding the right conditions to grow a plant. These include:

- Terraponics;
- Hydroponics;
- Ecoponics;
- Thermoponics;
- Omniponics.

Professional Approach

When working with plants, you may encounter various professions that have to do with this work. Firstly, there are Alta Poners - alta workers growing and looking after plants in general. There are also Alta Gatherers - ones who focus on regularly retrieving produce from crops and fruitful plants. Next, there are Alta Gardeners, who mostly manage decorative and high-variety gardens, often interacting with wild nature.

Then, there are Alta Preservers, who focus on archiving and studying rare plant species. Lastly, there are Alta Botanists, studying the field in general and finding a scientific approach to everything plant-related. There are also Alta Agronomists, Alta Plant GEs and Alta Elin Researchers, but their function won't be discussed as part of this book.
