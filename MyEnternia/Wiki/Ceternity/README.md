The holiday revolves around **Ceternity**, a mysterious being whose abstract, colorful face appears on posters and decorations throughout alta settlements.

## Traditions

**Dressing up** - Altas enthusiastically embrace costume culture, often going for elegant clothing in spooky color schemes, from dark dresses to witch robes.

**Jack O' Lanterns** - Altas carve traditional jack o' lanterns from local produce: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/special/events/ceternity/neonjack/icon.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [Neonjacks](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Neonjack) (carved from neonmelons with teal-green glow) and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/special/events/ceternity/yaajack/icon.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [Yaajacks](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Yaajack) (carved from yaara melons with orange glow). Both feature internal natural light sources that glow eerily in the dark, creating the perfect spooky atmosphere.

**Decorative posters** - Featuring Ceternity's abstract face, along with traditional Halloween and Harrowing-themed designs. These posters serve as both decoration and cultural acknowledgment of similar holidays celebrated by other species.

**Spooky greetings** - Common phrases include 'Happy Ceternity!' 'Boo!' 'It's spooky season!' 'The spooky's are coming!' and playfully threatening 'Hold on tight, stranger, I might bite! Hehe~'

## Celebrants

During Ceternity season, you can attract festive alta tenants to your colony by decorating rooms with appropriate tags. These celebrants will pay rent in the form of Ceternity candies and decorations!

### Ceternity Girls

Alta celebrants who dress up in spooky elegant attire for the holiday. They can be attracted by creating rooms with:

- **[Ceternity girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaCeternityGirl)**
- **[Halloween girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaHalloweenGirl)**
- **[Harrowing girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaHarrowingGirl)**
- **[Spooky girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaSpookyGirl)**

These tenants wear various elegant costumes including dark dresses and vampire costumes. They use [Ceternity dialog](/dialog/alta.config) and pay rent every 30-45 minutes from the Ceternity gift pool.

### [Ceternity Merchants](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaCeternityMerchant)

A special merchant who sells Ceternity-themed goods during the season! Dressed in wizard robes with a spooky flair, this alta merchant offers all 8 varieties of Ceternity candy.

This merchant is more difficult to attract but provides access to the complete Ceternity candy collection through their shop inventory.

### [Shadow Guests](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaRelations#shadows)

During Ceternity, altas often invite [shadows](https://starbounder.org/Shadow) to join them celebrating - considering their ghostly nature, it's a very fitting place for a sudden spook!

Any possible civilization of shadows remains a mystery to altas, but their relationship seems to be mostly positive, especially when all encounters happen expectedly. Ceternity provides the perfect atmosphere for shadows to feel welcome and embrace their naturally spooky aesthetic~ ðŸ‘»

### [Spooksmen](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Spooky)

These professionally spooky people from outer space are always welcome on Ceternity parties! Known for their expertise in creating eerie atmospheres and thrilling scares, spooksmen often collaborate with altas to enhance the holiday experience. Their presence adds an extra layer of excitement and mystery to the celebrations.

## Cultural Context

Hallowing Ceternity shares similarities with Earth's Halloween and the Elithian Alliance's Harrowing, while having it's own unique elements:

- The use of **bioluminescent carved yaara melons and neonmelons** instead of traditional pumpkins and turnips with candles
- **Inclusive atmosphere** - Altas acknowledge that different species have their own versions of spooky season celebrations (Halloween for humans, Harrowing for Elithian species), and will celebrate alongside them, even inviting shadows (ghostly void creatures) to join celebrations
