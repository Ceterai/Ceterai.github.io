# EDS Researcher Coat

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/armors/alta/clothing/researcher_coat/icon.png" alt="EDS Researcher Coat icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> **EDS Researcher Coat** is a rare chest cosmetic item.

An official EDS researcher's coat. Practical and well thought-out.  
Just like other pieces of alta laboratory attire, this one provides full body coverage with optional gloves to complete the set.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A nice middleground between official-ness and practicality.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
