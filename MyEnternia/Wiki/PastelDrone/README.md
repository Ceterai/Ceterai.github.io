<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/scout.png" alt="Pastel Drone ★ icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Pastel Drone ★** is an uncommon throwable item.

An observer drone, used by [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) scouts to scan the area.  
While it doesn't possess any actual combative power, it's still very useful and will do anything to defend its ally.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Probably the most common drei model out there. Even some [personal drone](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/personaldrone) models are based off of it.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.
