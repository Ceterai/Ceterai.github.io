Contains random loot from [aric](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Aric) depth biome chests.  
High levels of toxicity are a common case with this category of crates, thus the High Toxicity markings all over the casing.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I better watch out spores. I'm sure these pads are designed by professional altas, but additional safety is always advised by them too.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- I detected an alta loot crate in your inventory. These minipods contain random loot from related chests and pods. Altas use them for fast compact transfer, thus everything inside is packed tightly. You won't be able to put things back if you open it.
