<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> [Stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) crystals are falling from the sky! These crystals are small, but are hard to avoid and deal damage on impact. Be careful!  
Alta: This can actually be dangerous. While staris cals are not that hard, having them hit you full force while falling from eva is not very fun.
