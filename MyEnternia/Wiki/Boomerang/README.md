# Boomerang

 **Boomerang** is a common boomerang.

A simple alta toy with powerful thrusters. You won't use it for hurting anyone, right?  
Its simple shape and common alta colors make it a staple in alta culture and a common item at [alterash riverside](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/alterashriverside) resorts.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: What a classic. I should play with the girls sometimes if I happen to have this with me.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
