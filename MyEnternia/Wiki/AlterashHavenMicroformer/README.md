Transforms an area of a planet into a haven field. An alta attempt at creating smaller-scale terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs.  
[Alterash Haven](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AlterashHaven) is a colourful flowery biome inhabited by different critters and other peaceful creatures. However, this place also contains higher levels of toxins, that cause the growth of so many flowers and as a result, is considered a threat to iora climate.
