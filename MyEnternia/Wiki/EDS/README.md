<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/ct_eds_loot.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="autopx" height="16pxpx"> **Elerune Defensive System** is a "Security and Defences" project that formed as a reaction to a serious spike in danger caused by exploration of new worlds, discoveries of unstable energy sources and the creation of kaiters.

EDS manufactures protective and destructive equipment, as well as security devices such as [combat drones](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDS#robots) and [stationary turrets](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDS#turrets).

All of the mentioned devices, as well as multiple defensive protocols and alta security systems, are controlled by EDS's decentralized multifunctional AI.

#### Visual Style

The reinforced platings that cover EDS structures can withstand powerful energy strikes and even rocket blasts.

This is achieved by the usage of armor units made from a special metal compound.

The dark cybermilitaristic style used by EDS is called **Ectolar**.

The **red** stripes are the official EDS markings and are the easiest way to recognize EDS technology.

### Attitude Towards The Player

Mostly hostile. Defensive drones, droids and EDS NPCs will attack the player, when encountered in the wild. EDS-captured land is filled with traps and other hazards.
