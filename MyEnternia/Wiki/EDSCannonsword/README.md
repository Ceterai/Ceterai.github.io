This weapon is now a powerful device that can hold any threat back, no matter how far away it is.  
The enhanced CDR is now able to launch powerful [EDS rockets](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDSrockets) at the targets. Packed with the _Litera-7_ homing system, it's able to find it target after a charge.

_Centar Thruster_ is what causing the weapon to propell forward, with the use of mentioned rockets as push charges.

## Ingame

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
