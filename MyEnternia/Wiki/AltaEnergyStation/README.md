An [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alta) energy technology workshop for crafting [energy tools](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Weapons), wiring, and electronic devices.  
The Alta Energy Station is a tier 6 comprehensive energy systems workshop dedicated to electrical and electronic fabrication. This advanced station produces [energy tools](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Weapons) (what altas call weapons - energy projectors, plasma emitters, ionic disruptors), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/scout/energy_source/icon.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [wiring components](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/WiringComponents) for circuit construction, electronic <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/augments/back/ct_eds_augment.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [augments](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Augments) for equipment enhancement, and various small energy devices like scanners and tools. It features energy cell assembly equipment, circuit board fabrication systems, and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/alta/calotronics.png" alt="Calotronics icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [calotronics](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Calotronics) (crystal-based electronics) integration tools. The station represents alta mastery over electrical engineering and energy manipulation.

- Alta: My energy workshop! This is where we build energy tools (the scientific term for weapons), wiring, augments, and all sorts of electronic devices~
- Apex: Alta energy systems workshop. Their circuit design methodology differs interestingly from ours.
- Avian: A workshop for energy devices and electric tools! Lightning harnessed for creation.
- Floran: Makesss energy weaponsss and wiring thingsss. Floran likesss sharp better but energy good.
- Glitch: Intrigued. Their terminology 'energy tools' for weapons reveals their scientific perspective.
- Human: Electronics workshop! Energy weapons, wiring, augments - all the electrical stuff.
- Hylotl: A station honoring the flow of energy. The alta understand electricity as a natural force to guide.
- Novakid: Energy device maker! All sorts of electrical gadgets, weapons, and wirin' components.
