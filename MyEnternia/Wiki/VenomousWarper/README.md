# Venomous Warper

 **Venomous Warper** is a rare poisonous unique weapon.

A full on creature that you can wear on your hand. Be careful - its tentacles are pretty venomous...

## Ingame

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
