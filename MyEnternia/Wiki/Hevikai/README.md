# Hevikai

A disease-like immunity issue found in ^#0050c0;hevika^reset; areas, that can cause various creatures to start slowly produce plasma in their body. To most organisms this process could be lethal.  
To some this might lead to an increase in energy and power in exchange for sanity, however, the end is usually the same as always.
