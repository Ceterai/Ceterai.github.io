# Alta Monitor

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/basic/monitor/icon.png" alt="Alta Monitor icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Alta Monitor** is a common decorative object.

A wall mounted titanium monitor. Doesn't really show anything. May need configuring first.  
Most basic alta furniture is designed to be simple, lightweight, and, most importantly, easy to clean and disassemble. The goal is to be comfortable and portable at the same time, while also being easy to recycle if needed.
