An impressive, massive energy tool, able to produce enhaced energy pellets. This great power often comes a lot of weight, so make sure to bring an exo-skeleton.  
Named after a major EDS center that emraced enternia technology, this tool reflects that energy by isolating that anargy from all the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust).

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: One of the heavier EDS defense developments, literally. Not very high on amount of functions, but pretty high on blastpower instead.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
