# True Power Of Alta Tenant Merchants

If you go through the original auto-generated My Enternia <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/9/93/Colony_Deed.gif" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Tenant Guide](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tenants), you'll see that multiple large sections of it are either dedicated to merchant NPCs, or at least have a lot of them in the list.  
This is because almost every group of alta tenants have their own themed merchant, resulting in **32** different merchants as of **2.4.0**.  
This includes **5** biome merchants, **1** themed merchant and **10** science merchants - providing a wide range of items of all categories and themes.

## Biome Loot

If you're looking for items that you'd usually only be able to find as loot in a specific biome, you might want to spawn a biome merchant instead see if you can simply buy those items from them.

A good example of this is [Yaara Merchant](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/YaaraMerchant) - an alta (or a floran) ready to sell you a random selection of rare yaara loot and decor. Keep in mind that in order to spawn this tenant, you'd still need to find some yaara loot to make sure you have enough yaara-tagged decor.

Some biome merchants, like [Viona Merchant](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/VionaMerchant), can sell an even bigger amount of items, than what you would find in chests in said biome.

## Themed Loot

Looking for christmas decor and gifts? You can try to spawn in an [Alta Christmas Girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaChristmasGirl). Though, if you're looking for toys specifically, you might turn your attention to an [Alta Party Girl](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaPartyGirl) instead. There are also plans to add an Alta Toy Girl NPC and tenant that only sells toys and other things for and from <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/toymaker/icon.png" alt="Alta Toymaker icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Alta Toymaker](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaToymaker), as well as other Starbound toys like paintball guns.

Looking for [Miniknog](https://starbounder.org/Miniknog) things? You'll need an [MKI Archiver](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/MKIArchiver). MKI is an alta research initiative that stands for Miniknog Infiltration, and is centered around investigating and studying apex technology. Therefore, MKI's archiver sells items that relate to Miniknog and its style.

## Science Loot

If there's a scientific field studied by altas, there's an alta archiver selling items related to that science. This includes geology ([Ghearun Archiver](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/GhearunArchiver)), energy ([Hevika Archiver](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/HevikaArchiver)), botanics ([Gyera Archiver](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/GyeraArchiver)), etc.  
See the [Scientific](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tenants#Scientific) section for a full list of science fields encompassed by altas.
