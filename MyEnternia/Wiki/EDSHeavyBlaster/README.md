# EDS Heavy Blaster ★★

 **EDS Heavy Blaster ★★** is a rare fiery shotgun.

This armored cannon containing a powerful phosic energen can generate multiple accelerated blasts at once.  
All the armor hide a complex cooling system needed to contain and redirect all the energy from the phosicores inside.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: One of the heavier EDS defense developments, literally. Not very high on amount of functions, but pretty high on blastpower instead.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
