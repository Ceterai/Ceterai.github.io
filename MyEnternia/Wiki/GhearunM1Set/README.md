<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/ghearun.png" alt="Ghearun M1 Set icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Ghearun M1 Set** is a legendary loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) researcher from [gheatsyn](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Gheatsyn) labs, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
**Ghearun Researchers** are generally geologists, operating mostly around gheatsyn environments. This set is meant to provide relative poison protection, while increasing wearer's strength.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: This looks quite safe and reliable. Although I'm not entirely sure how to operate it - apparently ghearun equipment comes with custom geology-related system, and I'm not really a ghearun geologist, unfortunately.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
