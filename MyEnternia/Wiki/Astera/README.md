# Astera

 **Astera** is a planetary [biome](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Biomes).

A cluster of various-sized asteroids. Some of them are so convenient, that [altas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) have built their space stations on them, as well as numerous <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/datamass/astera.png" alt="Astera Industries icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Astera Industries](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AsteraIndustries), scattered amond the floating rocks, all around <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) planets.  
These places often feel like small cosmic cities, when inhabited by altas. When they're not, a no-less magical landscape occurs, full of beautifully shining specs of stardust all aroung reflecting the sunlight, creating a spectacular light show, also known as **astera's glow**.
