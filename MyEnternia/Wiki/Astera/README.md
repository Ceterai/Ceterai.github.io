A cluster of various-sized asteroids. Some of them are so convenient, that [altas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) have built their space stations on them, as well as numerous <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/datamass/astera.png" alt="Astera Industries icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [Astera Industries](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AsteraIndustries), scattered amond the floating rocks, all around <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) planets.
