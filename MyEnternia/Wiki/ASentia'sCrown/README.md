<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/warped.png" alt="A Sentia's Crown icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **A Sentia's Crown** is an uncommon codex entry.

This ebook tells the story about a powerful [nivera sentia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/niverasentia), a mystical creature, trying to make friends to show them her little garden.  
Sentias are alta-like arachnas, that use special paralyzing venom, tricks in form of love gifts and other secret ways to catch unsuspecting altas and force them to be their friend.  
Sentias are usually used as a scary story to teach altas about caution and trust.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: The moral of the story is that you should be wary of tricky evil sentias, and to not fall for their love tricks, so you don't end up a plaything to treat their loneliness, and that there are good sentias too, who try to make friends in a less forceful way.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've found an alta ebook - a collimator electronic reader usually used as a reusable substitute for books. Often crafted in alta datacenters.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
