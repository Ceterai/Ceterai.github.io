# Alterash Riversides

 **Alterash Riversides** is a planetary [biome](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Biomes).

This steppe area is riddled with rivers and underground waters and thus has rich vegetation that you would commonly find in places like these, like thickets of reeds and willow-like trees. [Altas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alta) use this coastal zone for resorts and camping, using the reeds as crafting materials for tents and deck chairs. Underneath the ground you can find many different semi-flooded caves with crystal-clear water and interesting rock formations.

This place is a home to brightly-colored <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/biome/alterash/koywa/grass/bushy/icon.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [verriskoywa](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/VerriskoywaPrimeGrass) flowers, these swampy plains are full of tall grass and willow-like trees called gianas.  
Professional chefs often come here in search of a rare spice - [veraltai](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/VerriskoywaAltoFlower#veraltai), made from petals of [koywa altos](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/VerriskoywaAltoFlower).

Under the ground there are harmless [[moonrock stalactites|Lunatai Stalactite]] with water from the rivers slowly dripping onto just as harmless [[moonrock stalagmites|Lunatai Stalagmite]], forming dense electrified ponds right under the surface.
