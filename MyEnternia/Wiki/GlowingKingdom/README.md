# Glowing Kingdom

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/warped.png" alt="Glowing Kingdom icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> **Glowing Kingdom** is an uncommon codex entry.

A storybook about the bright-colored patches of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/biome/ct_warped_loot.png" alt="Warped Forest icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [warped forests](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/WarpedForest). A more technical translation from alkey would be "Bioluminescent Capital".  
The book refers to warped plants filled with [yonnur](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Warped#yonnur) - a bioluminescent liquid that comes in different colors and can be found in special bulbs in things like <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/biome/alterash/warped/decorative/light/icon.png" alt="Warped Light icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [warped lights](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/WarpedLight).

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A good educational read for altas that prefer staying at home to adventuring, and to corfal patients as a bedtime story.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've found an alta ebook - a collimator electronic reader usually used as a reusable substitute for books. Often crafted in alta datacenters.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.

### Contents

Once upon a time, there was a very colorful kingdom. It was deep under the ground, where no light reaches from the surface.

But it wasn't dark in the kingdom. If anything, it was quite the opposite - the glow that was coming from it was illuminating everything around it, sometimes reaching as far as the ceiling of the cave.

There was no one living in that kingdom, too. No altas that is. The creatures that lived there were very colorful too, just like the rest of it!  
When the creatures grew hungry, they drank the very special essence from the glowing plants of the kingdom, that was making it so glowy.  
The sap was making them glow too, and they were glowing together with everything else around them.  
This way, some of the creatures learned how to have their own glowing essence, and stopped taking it from plants around them.

No longer relied on the kingdom, they have spread into the wapred forests around them, filling them with beatiful glow, and guarding it from intruders.

So be careful, silly altas, and don't go alone to a warped forest, its inhabitors don't really like starnge, lonely visitors...
