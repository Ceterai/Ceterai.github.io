# EDS Defensive Droid ★★

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/droids/defensive.png" alt="EDS Defensive Droid ★★ icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> **EDS Defensive Droid ★★** is a rare electric throwable item.

A protective machine that could take on a tank.  
Packed with an arsenal of different energy generators and missile launchers, it's unable to fly and thus has to walk on the ground.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: These usually guard EDS stations and camps. Mostly just stand around and play lazers with other dreis and drons.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.
