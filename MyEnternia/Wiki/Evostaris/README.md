# Evostaris

A cloudy area mostly filled with air - although due to a specific atmospheric pressure and ionization, the clouds here are (mostly) dense enough to stand on. This place is a home of arknights - brave [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) fighters protecting the planet from threats from above, as well as helping to keep the order on the surface.  
The dense <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) [clouds](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/clouds) mentioned earlier are small formations of dense cloud-like matter that stardust can get stuck in on its way to the ground.
