# Enchanted Shield ★

 **Enchanted Shield ★** is an uncommon cryogenic shield.

A very familiar shield, corrupted by [viona](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Viona) anomalies.  
The crystallized globe near the center feels alive in a way. The energy it radiates is similar to miazmas and.. ...did it twitch?..

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: This looks like a corrupted warped shield. As if that's... even a thing? Can you corrupt what's already corrupted? I guess vionia can.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You're holding an alta shield. My database shows an enhanced set of features, loading a proper description for you. Protection is known to be a prominent topic in alta culture and a big research field as well, so this might be worth checking out.
