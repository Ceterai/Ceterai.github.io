Armor of this shield has beed encrusted with <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust). With more power come more powerful effects!  
The basic energy has been increased, which also allowed for new, heavier systems to be installed. This is common practice with stardust-enhanced and enternia-enhanced EDS tech.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A very sturdy shield, it's a shame it only protects your front. Although, I guess you could put another one on your back...

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You're holding an alta shield. My database shows an enhanced set of features, loading a proper description for you. Protection is known to be a prominent topic in alta culture and a big research field as well, so this might be worth checking out.
- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
