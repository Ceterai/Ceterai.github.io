Transforms a planet's climate into alterash. An alta attempt at creating planet-wide terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs.  
[Alterash](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alterash) is a moonlike planet with temperate climate and slightly ionized atmosphere, and a surface affected by constant stardust fallouts. The high level of ions in the air is what makes this planet's atmosphere a magnet for all that stardust. However, it also causes it to crystallize, resulting in beautiful prisms.
