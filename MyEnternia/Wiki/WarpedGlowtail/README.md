A decorative [wapred](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/wapred) tail-like growth that dimly glows in the dark. Stylish!  
While not very practical, it's 100% eco-friendly and does provide a tiny lightsource.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A [yonnur](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/yonnur)-filled decorative tail. Sounds neat. Looks neat. Now where do I stick it into?

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
