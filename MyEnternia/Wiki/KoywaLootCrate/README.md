Contains random loot from [alterash riversides](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/alterashriversides) and [flooded alterash caves](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/floodedalterashcaves) chests.  
Mostly beach-related and swimming attire. These crates can commonly be found on riverside resorts as rentable beach packs, but can be used for other purposes too.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Oh, oh, I hope it has a floatie in it! With a staris poi on it! Or a firin! Or both!

Radiomessages on pickup:

- I detected an alta loot crate in your inventory. These minipods contain random loot from related chests and pods. Altas use them for fast compact transfer, thus everything inside is packed tightly. You won't be able to put things back if you open it.
