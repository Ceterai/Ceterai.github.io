A combat <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) relic that has now been restored. Let's see what does its full potential hold...  
Hopefully, with enough energy this thing can finally meet its creators' expectations, or perhaps even exceed them. The power of stardust can sometimes know no boundaries...

An upgrade for <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_bishyn_spear.png" alt="Bishyn Spear icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Bishyn Spear](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/BishynSpear).

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: The handle is so smooth, yet it grips quite nicely too, that's very cool! Not a lot of uses to it though. I know that these are sometimes used to manually carve different weaker crystals, like gheatsyn, but I don't think I plan on doing anything like that.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.

## Parameters

### Refined Bishyn Blade

A sequence of 4 (+1) light strikes. Hold to perform a Hold Super-Strike.
Enters a charged state every 5 (-5) seconds, making next 5 (+1) hits deal bonus [poison](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Poison) damage.  
The crystallic mix used as rim cover is harder then a lot of crystals. The only things able to significantly overshadow it are <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/e/ea/Diamond.png" alt="Diamond icon" loading="lazy" width="16px" height="16px"> [diamonds](https://starbounder.org/Diamond) and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_alternia_shard.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [hevika](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Hevika) crystals.
