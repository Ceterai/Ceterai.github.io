Let's see what does its full potential hold...  
Hopefully, with enough energy this thing can finally meet its creators' expectations, or perhaps even exceed them. The power of stardust can sometimes know no boundaries...

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: The handle is so smooth, yet it grips quite nicely too, that's very cool! Not a lot of uses to it though. I know that these are sometimes used to manually carve different weaker crystals, like gheatsyn, but I don't think I plan on doing anything like that.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
