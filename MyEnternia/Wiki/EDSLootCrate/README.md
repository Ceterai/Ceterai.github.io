Contains random loot from <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/eds/decorative/pod/icon.png" alt="EDS Pod ★★ icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> [EDS pods](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDSPod).  
This standardized emergency equipment package was designed to be shipped to or taken to combat points by [EDS guards](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDSGuard) for in-time resupply and additional support. This ensures quick point capture and initial defense, as opposed to EDS pods, that are delivered later and can provide long-term support instead.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A pad full of EDS goodies. I'm not even sure if I should open it, who knows what dangerous things lie inside. Better as someone else to open it for me.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- I detected an alta loot crate in your inventory. These minipods contain random loot from related chests and pods. Altas use them for fast compact transfer, thus everything inside is packed tightly. You won't be able to put things back if you open it.
