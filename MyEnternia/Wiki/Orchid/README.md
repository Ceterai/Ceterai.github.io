# Stardust Orchid

A tiny gathering of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) specks that likes to travel around the universe, looking for trouble and adventures, to have fun, make new friends, and to enjoy the wonders of existence.

Her full name is **Stardust Orchid Ceterai** (**Astiana Ceterai** from **alkey**), or **Tiana**/**Astia**/**Orchi**/**Tia** for short. **Ceterai** is her last name - though the full name is often shortened to just **Stardust Orchid** or **Orchid Ceterai** for brevity.

Even though [Io](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Io), the world Orchi was born in, considers every stardust speck her child, she allowed [Ceterai](https://ceterai.github.io/), her mother, to share consciousness with Tia as one of the **Ceterai sisters** - powerful stardust beings, driven by Ceterai to accomplish certain goals for her, both throughout Ceterai, and in other reachable universes as well, thus allowing the Stardust Orchid to travel across universes to see new places and meet new friends, while simultaneously giving her life a purpose. In a way, Orchid is Ceterai's self-insert into her own universe - a piece of herself experiencing existence.

## Appearance

A tall (185 cm), slender, mostly androgynous, slightly feminine figure with an ethereal, cosmic appearance. As a stardust being (fallen star), her form is not biological in the traditional sense - she is not made of flesh and blood, but of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) and cosmic energy.

### Physical Features

- **Stardust Crystal Horns** - A pair of stardust crystals that grow naturally from the top of her head, curving gently upward and slightly outward. They display a gradient from **ceterteal** at the base to **ionic purple** at the tips, marked with glowing **alkey** runic symbols.
- **Skin** - Extremely pale, almost porcelain white with faint cool lavender/gray undertones.
- **Eyes** - Her eye sockets are hollow voids (appearing black), within which float glowing **omniblue spheres** that serve as her eyes. These spheres can change color based on her emotional state - **omniblue** normally, **ionic purple** when she's up to no good, and **ceterteal stars** when amazed.
- **Hair** - Long length with a wavy, slightly tousled texture. Dark brown/black base color with **ionic purple/violet tones** showing through, especially at the ends. Always worn with a high ponytail, with loose strands framing her face.
- **Lips** - Dark cherry or deep blue-violet.
- **Hands** - Slender fingers with pointed, claw-like nails.

### Typical Attire

- **Accessory** - A dark navy/blue collar (choker-style) with a metal buckle or ring attachment.
- **Top** - Gray off-shoulder crop top exposing her shoulders and midriff.
- **Bottom** - Dark shorts with a belt.
- **Legwear** - Fishnet or checkered-pattern stockings (asymmetrical - one leg covered, one bare).
- **Style** - Gothic-cute, slightly alternative.

## Character

Gone slightly eccentric from the mysteries of her own existence, she keeps it together by maintaining a relatively relaxed outlook on life.

Though challenging moments might take over her for a while from time to time, causing her to reflect on the nature of existence, she strongly believes in a light at the end of any tunnel, even if she has to make one herself.

Often petty and spiteful, she holds a special warm place for altas in her heart and tries to do good for them despite all the problems.

## History

It was because of her that with Io's help, Celestia, the mother star of Io, and other little stars like Orchi, created [altas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alta) - to make sure these lonely beings always have friends, support, and a place to come home to.

### Thirty Circles

Unfortunately for both Celestia and Orchi, one of the alta prototypes, Mira - the very first one, ended up being excessively attached to the latter, showing an unhealthy interest in her and, in a misguided effort to ensure safety and care for the Orchid, she trapped her in Mira's own simulated reality bubble, trying to make sure the Orchid lives a safe and stable life in a small bit of space she created.

This lifestyle didn't fit the adventurous pile of stardust, and she ended up trying to escape what had become her little prison.

Mira didn't like this, and saw it as a personal mistake - instead of letting the Orchid go, she reset the simulation and erased Orchi's memory, forcing her to live the process all over again.

Unfortunately, this didn't help, and led to the exact same outcome as last time. And yet, Mira didn't stop there, and did another reset. Then again. And again. And again.

This went on for long 29 cycles, until something... unusual happened on a lucky 30th run.

As it turned out, one of the other Mira prisoners, a mysterious **void being**, has been watching Orchi throughout all cycles silently, unaffected by the resets. On the 30th cycle, she finally decided to help the starlike being escape, finally breaking the loop.

This allowed the Orchid to flee far away from Io, going into hiding and ending up warping herself beyond recognition, just to be able to withstand against a passionate, yet misguided ally.

### Exile

In a place overlooked by Io, on a planet no alta has ever stepped a foot on, little Orchid found her new home among mountains, caves and oceans through and through infested by the Warped Growth.

Being a fairly uncommon occurrence in inhabited sectors, with constant monitoring and attempts to contain and regulate it, warped growth was very different here, in a place where nothing could or wanted to resist its spread - a home where it thrived in its chaotic bliss. It was... vibrant, lush, evolved. It was sprouting with life, mutating, improving, with endless species of both fauna and flora in their own warped ecosystem.

The Orchid was stunned and captivated by this never before seen beauty, and quickly developed a liking to the so-called infestation, as if love for warpness was always living somewhere deep inside her heart. This strange, dangerous place felt more like home than anywhere she'd been since the imprisonment.

Slowly but surely, she herself began changing as well. Living constantly in harmony with the chaos of nature, it slowly fused with her - not simply warping her - but coming in tune with her body to result in something bigger, faster and stronger. She became one with her new family - seemingly endless hordes of warped creatures, listening to her every thought.

Similar to nivera sentias on alta planets, she became one of the first stardust sentias in Io - **Sen'Tia Ceterai**. She also gave a name to the infestation she was now part of as well, making it known as **Are'Naash**. The planet itself was later named **Are'Stia** by her - after both herself and the warped ecosystem on it.

#### Warped Transformation

Orchid's transformation occurred in stages, each more severe than the last:

- **Stage 1: Sen'Tia** - Her face became partially skeletal, with bone-white structures emerging around her eye sockets and nose. Her eyes shifted to glowing **magenta/pink** - a dangerous purple. Her jaw warped with iridescent, jagged teeth dripping with dark warped fluids. Stardust spikes began protruding from her shoulders.
- **Stage 2: Fully Warped** - Her face became almost entirely void-black and skeletal, the bone structure cracking and fragmenting. Multiple small yellow-green eyes peered out from the darkness of her hollow face - like the warped creatures she had become one with. She was falling apart, barely holding form.

Throughout all stages, her **stardust crystal horns** remained intact - the last piece of who she truly was.

And yet, even with new powers and a whole hive as an army, she was too afraid to return back home - not so much because of Mira, but because of altas in general - she didn't want them to know what she has become, fearing of being rejected. Still yet, she made multiple attempts to make secretive visits to several planets, just to see once familiar life again, even if from afar, and to come to help, where she still felt she could do so.

She knew this transformation would make her more dangerous, more likely to be hunted. But she also knew she couldn't run forever. At some point, she needed to stop, turn around, and take her stand. The warping gave her the power to do just that - to withstand and face down her pursuer, even if it meant becoming something unrecognizable.

### Confrontation

After becoming fully <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_warped_hive.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [warped](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/WarpedForest), she finally fell apart at the hands of Mira. Thinking this is over, Mira returned her fleet back to alta-inhabited systems. Being unable to bring herself to confront her sisters, she ended up escaping to the pocket void and putting the entire Al'deron into stasis.

And yet, Ceterai had another fate in store for the Orchid.

### Rebirth

"We all fall apart... sometimes..."

Ceterai made multiple attempts to resurrect the Orchid, fusing the remnants of the specks containing her memories, thoughts and soul with various beings from other universes that she deemed fit to be the new Orchid Ceterai. Or, at least a part of her composite image.

Her first companions ended up being several altas, plant-like creatures and even a long-eared humanoid, all of whom she named after variations of the Orchid's name.

Note: This slow rebirth process is still happening during the events of the hidden My Enternia plot. The Orchid's death happened long ago, but her resurrection takes time...

After a long process and numerous adventures, she was able to connect and unite them into the new, reborn **Stardust Orchid - The Lord of the Fallen Apart**. The reborn Orchid is **no longer warped** and does not possess her previous warped powers - she is restored to her original stardust form.

From here, Ceterai presented Orchi with a new purpose in life - to help her realize her plans, with the first mission being to raise two more Ceterai sisters for herself.

To help reborn Orchid in her adventures, Celestia gifts her a new friend - Asirai - which she accepts with gratitude, finally having someone to talk to.
