**WIP**. A venomous spear made of nivera thorns. Strange scars on its bone handle look similar to a signature.  
It's unknown who's bone exactly this is, or if it's even a bone to begin with. If you examine it real closely, you might sense a slight pleasant smell of parfumes.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I don't think I should touch this. But I kinda want to... Nope! I might prick a finger, and it seems slightly poisonous.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.

## Parameters

### Estria's Wrath

**WIP**. A sequence of 4 (+1) light strikes. Hold to perform a Super Heavy Slash.
Enters a charged state every 5 (-5) seconds, making next 5 (+1) hits deal bonus electric damage.  
Seems like its previous owner could handle it with ease, but numerous spikes might not make it as easy for someone less experienced.

- Base Dps: 12
- Damage Config:
  - Damage Source Kind: `<elementalType>spear`
  - Knockback Mode: `aim`
  - Knockback: 10

- Hold Damage Config:
  - Timeout Group: `hold`
  - Timeout: 0.5
- Hold Damage Multiplier: 0.1

### Circles Of Love

Hold to perform a venom-spreading spear spin.  
Moderately poisonous, its main purpose is to immobilize its victims.
