Transforms an area of a planet into enchanted meadows. An alta attempt at creating smaller-scale terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs.  
[Vionostera](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Vionostera), or enchanted land, is an almost magical place full of mystical things, hence the name.  
Blue fields of dense grass with pink tops of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/biome/alterash/ayaka/ct_ayaka_blossom_tree.png" alt="Blossoming Ayaka icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> [blossoming ayakas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/BlossomingAyaka), [enchanted orbs](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/enchantedorbs) and rare [beakseed](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Beakseed) bushes showing above the surface.  
Under the ground there are glowing [enchanted bushes](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/enchantedbushes), lighting up the caves with pink bioluminescence.

This place looks almost magical, even though this kind of view is somewhat common for the ionized temperate climate.  
At its core, this place is an anomaly, caused by high concentration of conflicting energies.

A much rarer variation of this biome is called [Invertia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Invertia).
