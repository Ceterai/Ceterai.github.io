# Ava Day

**Type:** Gift-giving tradition

Ava Day is the alta gift-giving holiday, analogous to Earth's Valentine's Day but with broader cultural significance. While Earth's Valentine's Day focuses primarily on romantic love, Ava Day encompasses gift-giving across all relationship types - friends, caretakers, colleagues, and romantic partners.

**Traditions:**
- **Gift exchanges** - The central tradition involves thoughtful gift-giving to show appreciation for others
- **Chocolates** - Heart-shaped chocolates are traditional Ava Day gifts. As one alta notes: 'Valentine chocolates! Can't wait for Ava Day to gift it to someone~'
- **Plant-based treats** - Altas particularly appreciate that traditional chocolate gifts are plant-based and compatible with their herbivore diet: 'And chocolate is plant-based, so I can enjoy it too!'
**Cultural Context:** Ava Day demonstrates how altas adapt universal gift-giving traditions to their own cultural framework. Rather than adopting Valentine's Day directly, they created their own holiday with similar themes but distinct alta characteristics. The emphasis on chocolate's plant-based nature reflects alta biological considerations while maintaining cross-cultural connection through shared celebratory foods.

**Etymology:** The name 'Ava Day' likely derives from alta language roots, though specific etymological details remain undocumented in current records. The 'Ava' element may connect to concepts of affection, sharing, or appreciation in the alkey linguistic system.
