Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) Project Ceterai researcher, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
A dark set of powerarmor with enhanced [alternia](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alternia) synergy. It boosts the wearer's performance, while increasing energy capabilities significantly.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I think this set was designed by Ceterai herself. Interesting how these researchers got help from someone who seemingly went away. But then again, we're not the ones to blame her.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
