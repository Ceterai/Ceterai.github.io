# Scout Set

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/scout.png" alt="Scout Set icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Scout Set** is an uncommon loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) scout, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
Proper enhancement set to greatly improve one's mobility, while providing some protection and boosting energy to account for different scouting actions, like moving, scanning and using proto-tech.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Scava's clothes! I can wear them, to feel like I'm a real scava!! With a protospear!!!

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
