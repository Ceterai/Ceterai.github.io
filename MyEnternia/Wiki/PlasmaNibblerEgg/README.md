Can be used to spawn a critter called [plasma nibbler](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/plasmanibbler).  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: If you were to stop nibbling on plasma for a second, what would you be then, tiny critter?

## Parameters

### Critter

Critters can be _relocated_ with a _relocator_, and some of them _drop resources_ when hunted down with a _bow_.  
Look if the critter's shell or outer layer has grow a crystal or bionic matter on it, and remove it carefully to not damage the critter.
