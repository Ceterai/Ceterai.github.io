Can be used to spawn a critter called [plasma nibbler](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/plasmanibbler).  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.
