<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/shields/ct_kinetic_shield.png" alt="Orange Kinetic Shield icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Orange Kinetic Shield** is a rare electric shield.

This directional energy shield multiplies the impact and returns it to your enemies, launching them into the air.  
It's powered by and projected from a special tiny wrist device that connects to your armor.
