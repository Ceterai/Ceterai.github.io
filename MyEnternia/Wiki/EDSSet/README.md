# EDS Set

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/sets/eds.png" alt="EDS Set icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **EDS Set** is a rare loot item.

Contains full equipment set of an [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) [EDS](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Eds) soldier, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
EDS guards and soldiers are a building brick of EDS itself. Altough, recently, due to unforseen circumstances, the focus has shifted towards droids and out-of-control automated systems...

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A full-on EDS soldier look and feel... Extra protection from every little creature in existence. Why not?

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
