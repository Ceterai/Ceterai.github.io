Phosic tecnology is the main target content of this category of crates, but it is also often used as a general container for transporting of radioactive materials as well.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: There are Radioactive Hazards markings on this one. I don't think I'm supposed to touch it. Better leave it to [arco researchers](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/A.R.C.O.Researcher) instead.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- I detected an alta loot crate in your inventory. These minipods contain random loot from related chests and pods. Altas use them for fast compact transfer, thus everything inside is packed tightly. You won't be able to put things back if you open it.
