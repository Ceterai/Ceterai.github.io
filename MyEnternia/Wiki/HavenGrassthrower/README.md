## Ingame

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- The item you just got seems to have come for alterash haven - flowery areas on alterash planets that tend to have higher levels of toxicity than surrounding nature. Although it equals to toxicity levels on most green planets, it's not a usual sight here, so I would recommend being careful.
