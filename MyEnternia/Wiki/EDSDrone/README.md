# EDS Drone ★

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/eds.png" alt="EDS Drone ★ icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **EDS Drone ★** is a rare electric throwable item.

An advanced armored drone operated by [EDS](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Eds). Has additional armor layers.  
This is the most common EDS robot model, as it is versatile enough to be used in most types of operations.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A staple EDS drei. These always look more serious than, let's say, companion ones.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.
