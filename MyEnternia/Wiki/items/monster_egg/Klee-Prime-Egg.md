Can be sold for *80* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
Can be used to spawn a bug called [[ klee prime|klee-prime ]], a saturated version of a regular [[ klee|klee ]].  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.
