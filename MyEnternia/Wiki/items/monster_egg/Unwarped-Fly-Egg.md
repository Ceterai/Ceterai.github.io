![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/bugs/ct_unwarped_fly_egg.png) **Unwarped Fly Egg** is an uncommon lvl.4 monster_egg.  
Can be sold for *100* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
Can be used to spawn a bug called [[ unwarped fly|unwarped-fly ]], a much friendlier version of a [[ warped fly|warped-fly ]].  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.
