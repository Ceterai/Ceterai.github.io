![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/ranged/alta/rifle/ct_bipolaris.png) **Bipolaris** is a legendary lvl.6 ar.  
A tool of presicion that doesn't choose sides, but is able to switch between them. Some call it a weapon, and some... a work of art.  
Its wiring and energy flow is close to perfection, at least as much as possible for an alta.
