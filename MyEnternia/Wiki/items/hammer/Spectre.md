![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/heavy/ct_spectre.png) **Spectre** is a legendary lvl.6 hammer.  
A powerful battle axe. Its razor is made out of [[ stardust|stardust ]] energy and can change its polarity on a whim.  
These energy swaps, while spectacular, are quite unstable. Therefore, the Spectre tends to suffer from elemental offsets, where some of its abilities might get the element change with a certain delay.
