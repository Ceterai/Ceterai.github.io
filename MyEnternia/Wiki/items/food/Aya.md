Ayas grow on trees called ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/biome/alterash/ayaka/ct_aya_pile/icon.png) [[ ayaka|Ayaka ]], and thus don't have seeds as a separate item.

Known by non-alta species as an **Alta Peach** due to its taste and resemblance. Unlike [peaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach), ayas have no seed, since ayakas have a different method of reproduction.
