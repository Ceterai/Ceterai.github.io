![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/produce/ct_tsay.png) **Tsay** is a common lvl.2 food.  
Can be sold for *9* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
A very sour, slightly bitter, sometimes sweet fruit. What a mix.  
A well-balanced flavor great for soury products. For example, altas often substitute lemons with tsays in their lemonades and sodas as a more common and thus more affordable alterative.  
As a unique sideffect, when properly cooked, tsay can acquire a savory, almost meaty taste, making it a great multipurpose ingredient in cooking.
