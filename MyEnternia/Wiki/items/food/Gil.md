![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/produce/ct_gil.png) **Gil** is a common lvl.2 food.  
Can be sold for *9* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
Salty! At least on the outside.  
If you peel off it's tasty coat you'll reveal sweet insides filled with small nutty seeds that are thankfully fully okay to swallow.  
Together this fruit makes a pretty unique sweet and salty combination with a slight hint of a nut, making it hard to forget and pretty easy to distinquish.  
The easily separated flavors of this fruit make it very convenient for cooking.

Some varieties of gil can have slight taste differences, with some tasting somewhat similar to a [rambutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambutan) (pulp only).
