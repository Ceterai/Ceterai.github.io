![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/food/shop/ct_alta_soup_canned.png) **Canned Altasoup** is an uncommon lvl.3 food.  
Can be sold for *128* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
The best combination of boiled ayas, some fresh gils and cooked tsays.  
Might not be as tasty as a freshly made, manually-prepared [[ alta soup|alta-soup ]], but is still almost as fulfilling and has a decent taste.
