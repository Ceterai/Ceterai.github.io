Contains random loot from [[ alta|Alta ]] tier 5 pods.  
Seems like these are similar contents to the special SSR pods scattered around Io - they are regular protected [[ alta ship pods|alta-ship-pods ]] with unknown markings on them, often containing legendary items and equipment that can save an alta's life.
