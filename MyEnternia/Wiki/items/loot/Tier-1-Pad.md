Basic alta items often found in pods. Includes produce, meds, as well as basic [[ alta|Alta ]] decor, clothes and level 3 resources and equipment.  
These standardized crates a packed with goodies, seemingly with general decor and scout equipment. They are much more compact than [[ alta pods|alta-pods ]], but the items inside are heavily packed and compressed to be able to fit in. This, opening this crate is often a one-way ticket.
