![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/light/ct_staris_sword.png) **Staris Sword** is a legendary lvl.6 shortsword.  
**WIP**. Some say there's nothing more pure than stardust itself... But this tool comes close.  
Since it's made almost entirely out of stardust, it needs to be used with care to avoid unstable states and environments.
