![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/light/ct_sinigai.png) **Sinigai** is a legendary lvl.6 shortsword.  
**WIP**. Molten sword with an energy razor. What [[ alta|Alta ]] made this?  
On the surface, it looks very differently from what altas usually consider a sword, but it provides just as much power and functionality to count it as one.
