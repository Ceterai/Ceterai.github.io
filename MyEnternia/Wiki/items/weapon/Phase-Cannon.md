![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/ranged/alta/heavy/ct_phase_cannon.png) **Phase Cannon** is a legendary lvl.6 weapon.  
The eternal heat produced by this mysterious artifact can cause small phase states with charged [[ stardust|stardust ]] energy.  
The counterpart to that is the size and overall mass of this tool - it might be a bit too hard to hold it up without an exoskeleton...

#### Zeta Charges

Phase charges, or zeta charges, are a special type of radiation causing certain targets to enter a **phase corruption**. This corruption is a form of a space-time distortion around and inside the target. These distortions might be extremely harmful to most things with a structured consistence. It's not as effective against less structured matter, like ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_isoslime_ball.png) [[ isoslime|Isoslime ]].
