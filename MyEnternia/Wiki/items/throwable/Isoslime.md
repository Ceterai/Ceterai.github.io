![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_isoslime_ball.png) **Isoslime** is a common throwable.  
A chunk of ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_isoslime_ball.png) [[ isoslime|Isoslime ]] (a.k.a. izoslime) that you can maliciously throw at someone to cover them in cryonic goo. Or make jam out of it.  
**Isoslime**, or **Izoslime**, or **Izopoi** - is a cryogenic slimy substance that tends to form in the subsurface (and rarely surface) layer of ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_prime_planet.png) [[ alterash prime|Alterash Prime ]] planets. This substance is highly viscous and consists of two layers.  
The **outer** layer, or the **cryo layer**, is heat-isolation slime that protects the inner layer from low temperatures. This is a precious material that is often used by [[ altas|Alta ]] in construction.  
The **inner** layer, or the **poi layer**, consits of pure slime and is the main part of isoslime.

Isoslime is a subtype of regular <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/d/dc/Slime_Blob.png" width="10" height="14"/> [slime](https://starbounder.org/Slime_Blob).

#### Cooking

The cooking capabilities are described in [[ Isoslime in Cooking|Isoslime-in-Cooking ]] and the [[ nia cuisine book|nia-cuisine-book ]].

#### Izon

**Izon**, the cryogen that makes the cryolayer of izopoi, is also often used as a cooling material in things like refrigerators, as well as a method for [[ warped containment|warped-containment ]].
