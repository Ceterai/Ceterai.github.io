![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/defensive.png) **EDS Defensive Drone** is a legendary lvl.6 drone_deployer.  
Can be sold for *172* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
Hightech reinforced drone, model R300. Has powerful ranged attacks and protective shields.  
Another staple of technological advancement for altas. However, fully relying on unstable energy is rarely a good option, so this model leaves room for improvement.

#### R200

R200, or **PDR200**, is an older model of defensive drone, that was developed before altas were able to fully understand ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/damage/ct_ionic.png) [[ enternia|Enternia ]] and void energy. It used [[ mical|mical ]] crystals, found on asteroids on relatively safe distances from their ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_enterash_prime_planet.png) [[ enterash prime|Enterash Prime ]] planet origins, as energy concentrators, and had a much smoother armor structure compared to R300, similar to that of a [[ lava drone|lava-drone ]].
