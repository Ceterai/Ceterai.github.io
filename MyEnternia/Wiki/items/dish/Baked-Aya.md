![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/food/tier1/ct_aya_baked.png) **Baked Aya** is a common lvl.2 dish.  
Can be sold for *48* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
Crispy on the outside, filled with hot sweet, slightly sour jam. A rare recipe where the same ingredient is used both as dough and as filling.  
Due to relative easiness of preparation, this aya-dough bakery can be often found in local alta bakeries, and often with different filling options.
