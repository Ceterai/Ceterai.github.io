![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/heavy/ct_crystalline_sword.png) **Crystalline Sword** is a rare lvl.5 broadsword.  
The blade of this sword is made out of crystalline cave crystals. A bit rough around the edges, but still quite powerful.  
With no alta markings on it's [[ bionix|bionix ]] handle, its electro-crystallic conduction capabilities are very much Io-like.
