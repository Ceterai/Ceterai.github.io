![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/heavy/ct_barracuda_fin.png) **Barracuda's Fin** is an uncommon lvl.3 broadsword.  
All what's left from a mysterious beast. If it's this big, who knows what a giant this was...  
**Staris Ghura**, or the **Barracuda**, is a smaller subspecies of a powerful moster species of **Megasharks**, known by altas as **Kaghurao**. Cudas can get small enough to be able to live in [[ alterash riversides|alterash-riversides ]] and [[ flooded alterash caves|flooded-alterash-caves ]], but such a sight is still pretty rare, therefore finding a trophy like this is quite an accomplisment.

Barracudas' fins are pretty powerful and surprisingly easy to swing, and the sturdy bone spikes are hard enough to dent some metals.
