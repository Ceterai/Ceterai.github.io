![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_datamass.png) **Datamass** is an uncommon lvl.3 resource.  
Can be sold for *16* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
A compact encrypted data storage that can be used for storing blueprints, codex info and other data. Right now it's empty.  
A very popular mini-device among [[ altas|Alta ]]. Apart from being used as data storage, it can also be used as automated databases for other [[ alta technology|Alta#technology ]], like AI for [[ alta robotics|Alta#robotics ]].

Looks and works similarly to human USB Drives, except with integrated data protection measures, like encryption, and small shape differences - datamasses are cylindrical, so you don't have to worry about what side to insert it with, and have unified size regulations to be able to fit in most alta devices.
