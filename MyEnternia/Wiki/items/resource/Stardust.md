![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png) **Stardust** is a legendary lvl.7 resource.  
Put in a bowl and carefully mixed together.  
This mysterious and powerful powder, also known as **Staris** by [[ altas|Alta ]], is the energy matter of [[ Io|Io ]]. When a star explodes, the energy from it bursts in every direction, eventually crystallizing and forming tiny specks, filled with different types of [[ energy|World#energy ]].
