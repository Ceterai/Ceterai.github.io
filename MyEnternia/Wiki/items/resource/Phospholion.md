A sturdy metallic material that turns into a sufficient energy source in reaction to radiation.  
The material is popular with kaiters, since it can act both as a building/armor material (in calm state, after refining) and as an energy source and engine.

#### Origins

This light-gray material forms in harsh cold radioactive environments. Because of this, it's able to react with radiation by expanding into a contained energy source.

#### Mining

Phospholion is by altas in special [[ phospholion mines|phospholion-mines ]], also known as [[ energy mines|energy-mines ]]. They're often located right under the planetary surface due to perfect conditions for its existance.
