Can be sold for *24* <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/2/21/Pixel.png" width="12" height="16"/> [pixels](https://starbounder.org/Pixel).  
A bulletproof piece of composite cloth, mostly made from bion - purified ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_bionid.png) [[ bionid|Bionid ]]. Pure bion is able to bend well and provide heat retention, while mixes like bionix are hard and can barely bend.  
Encompasses different types of [[ bionics|bionics ]] developed by [[ altas|Alta ]].

It's worth noting that altas themselves partially consist of pure bion as well, along with <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/3/31/Crystal.png" width="12" height="16"/> [crystals](https://starbounder.org/Crystal) and [[ ionic ferment|ionic-ferment ]], and even ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/damage/ct_plasma.png) [plasma](Alternia#damage), all in relatively small ratios compared to bion.
