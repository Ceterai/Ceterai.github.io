![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_lira.png) **Lira** is a legendary lvl.6 spear.  
**WIP**. Each attack of this spear replenishes your energy.  
This instrument was made as part of a skylight orchestra, an interplanetary music concert performed by arknights. But as with many things, the wielder determines its purpose.
