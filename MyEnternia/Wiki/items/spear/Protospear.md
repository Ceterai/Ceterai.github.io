![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_protospear.png) **Protospear** is an uncommon lvl.4 spear.  
**WIP**. A scouting tool used by [[ altas|Alta ]] for travel. It doesn't have a sharp side, because the purpose of this instrument is not combat-related.  
Protospears are used to gather energy and covert it into kinetic force, allowing scouts to traverse the harshest terrain.
