![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_dream_eater.png) **Dream Eater** is a legendary lvl.6 spear.  
**WIP**. Each strike of this tool replenishes your energy. Use it to quickly recharge its special ability!  
No one really knows the origins of this energy-harvesting tool, except maybe for the [[ dreamers|dreamers ]]. But they won't tell you, or anyone, so the mystery stays a mystery.
