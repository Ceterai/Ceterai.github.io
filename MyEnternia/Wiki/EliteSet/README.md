Contains full equipment set of an elite [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Alta) soldier, including a lore codex of this set.
Is cheaper to craft this way than separately.  
Worn by elite alta forces, or **prime vardas**, this powerarmor set is focusing on protection and life support, as well as enhanced energy provision.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Looks like you have acquired a set of alta equipment. These usually contain a full set of armor with corresponding documentation. Due to being created in bulk, sets are often much cheaper to craft than it is to craft their components separately.
