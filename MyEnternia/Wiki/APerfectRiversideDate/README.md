_Season 2, Week 12_

Today was absolutely magical! Omnika and I went on the most wonderful date to a nearby [koywa resort](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/koywaresort)~ ❤

[Afternoon:](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Afternoon) We walked along the crystal-lined paths, hand-in-hand, watching strizychars dance between [miko koywa](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/mikokoywa) flowers.

Rare <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/biome/alterash/ayaka/ct_ayaka_tree.png" alt="Ayaka icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [ayakas](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Ayaka) in the resort's garden were in full bloom - so beautiful! We even found some fallen silk balls together as souvenirs~

[Calo Garden:](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/CaloGarden) The crystal garden was even more breathtaking! We took so many photos with rare formations, and she gave me a small mical crystal - it's so tiny it looks pink! I'll treasure it forever...

[Dinner:](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Dinner) The resort restaurant was **amazing**! We shared a delicious fruit bowl together, and had some grilled tsays with garnish and a fresh gil salad with rukas! Finally, we had a calin cake with luminescent frosting (so pretty it glowed! >~<)

The last part was especially delicious~

[Evening Entertainment:](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EveningEntertainment) We danced under the party lights at the resort club! The alta dancers' performance was incredible. We played some party games too - I even won at ring toss! ^^

[Stargazing:](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stargazing) We ended the night at the observation deck, watching stars and distant planets.

We talked about our dreams... She wants to become a [spacedrifter](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Spacedrifter) one day. I told her I'd wait for her, no matter how long...

And then... she gave me a kiss. My heart is still racing! ❤❤❤

I can't stop smiling. This is what happiness feels like...

_End of entry._
