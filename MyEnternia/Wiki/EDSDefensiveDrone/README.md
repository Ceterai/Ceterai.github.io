# EDS Defensive Drone ★

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/defensive.png" alt="EDS Defensive Drone ★ icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **EDS Defensive Drone ★** is a legendary throwable item.

Hightech reinforced drone, model R300. Has powerful ranged attacks and protective shields.  
Another staple of technological advancement for altas. However, fully relying on unstable energy is rarely a good option, so this model leaves room for improvement.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Remember when PDR200s where a breakthrough? And now, we are harnessing enternia... Look at us, and how far we've come, Io~

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.
