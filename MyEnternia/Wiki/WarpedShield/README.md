# Warped Shield ★

 **Warped Shield ★** is an uncommon poisonous shield.

It's not staring at you, I swear.  
Looks like a piece of natural warped growth, full on some sort of herbal bone-like matter, making it pretty sturdy.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I'm not scared, but I'd much rather stay behind it than in front of it. Espesially with the venomous sight and all.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You're holding an alta shield. My database shows an enhanced set of features, loading a proper description for you. Protection is known to be a prominent topic in alta culture and a big research field as well, so this might be worth checking out.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
