# Estria's Kiss ★

This nivera spear gives off a strong scent of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/generic/crafting/ct_stardust.png" alt="Stardust icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [stardust](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Stardust) and unknown pheromones. Holding it somehow feels a little wrong...  
It belongs to _Estria_, one of the [queens of thorns](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/queensofthorns). She used this spear to lure in and capture unsuspecting altas, in order to try and make friends. The venom isn't meant to be harmful to altas, as much as restrict their movement, preventing them from running away easily.

An upgrade for <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/spear/ct_niverisk.png" alt="Niverisk icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [Niverisk](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Niverisk).

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I don't think I should touch this. But I kinda want to... Nope! I might prick a finger, and it seems slightly poisonous.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
