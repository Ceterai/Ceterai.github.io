<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/biome/ct_warped_loot.png" alt="Warped Loot Crate icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Warped Loot Crate** is an uncommon loot item.

Contains random loot from [warped](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Tags/Warped) biome chests.  
A partially overgrown crate in nivera stylistics. Contains warped matter and related materials and resources.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: It's very pretty, but I should be wary of it spreading all over the place. How do you contain it again?

Radiomessages on pickup:

- I detected an alta loot crate in your inventory. These minipods contain random loot from related chests and pods. Altas use them for fast compact transfer, thus everything inside is packed tightly. You won't be able to put things back if you open it.
- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
