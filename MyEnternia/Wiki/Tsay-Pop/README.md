<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/deprecated/items/shop/cttsaycola.png" alt="Tsay-Pop icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Tsay-Pop** is an uncommon drink.

A fresh spin on the Tsay-Cola that definitely has more pop to it!  
Another pleasant variation that, while not having a great taste difference from the original, provides a new interesting texture and aftertaste.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: I really like the bluemix ones, although they're not as easy to find in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/codex/alta/ebook/security.png" alt="Alta Cities icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> [alta cities](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/AltaCities). If this is really how lemons can taste like, then I guess they're pretty neat.
