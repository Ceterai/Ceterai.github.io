An [alta](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Alta) heavy engineering station for constructing vehicles, mechs, and large-scale machinery.  
The Alta Architect Station is a tier 6 advanced heavy engineering workshop designed for fabricating extra-large devices and machinery. This massive station produces vehicles like hovercrafts and exploratory rovers, mechs for combat and construction, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/basic/bed/icon.png" alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [terraformers](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Terraformers) for planetary modification, and microformers for biome manipulation. It features heavy-duty assembly equipment, large-scale welding systems, and advanced CAD holographic design interfaces. The station represents the pinnacle of alta industrial engineering, capable of producing machinery far too large for standard crafting stations.
