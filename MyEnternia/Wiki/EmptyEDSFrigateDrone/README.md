# Empty EDS Frigate Drone ★★★

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/frigate_empty.png" alt="Empty EDS Frigate Drone ★★★ icon" loading="lazy" height=16px width="auto" /> **Empty EDS Frigate Drone ★★★** is a legendary electric throwable item.

This huge combat machine is able to construct new drones on the fly.  
Conveniently packed with a relatively powerful mical charge generator for self-defense, it will reserve to it in a dire situation.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Even mostly emptied out, it still can pose quite a threat. Very powerful.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.
