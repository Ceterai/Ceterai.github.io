# EDS Frigate Drone ★★★

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/frigate.png" alt="EDS Frigate Drone ★★★ icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> **EDS Frigate Drone ★★★** is a legendary electric throwable item.

This huge combat machine is able to construct new drones on the fly.  
Its body is designed to be able to act as a protected carrier, with lots of compactly placed minidrones and an additional defensive drone.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: A flying goliath with a buch of small dreis inside it. Some may wonder how it even stays afloat.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- The item you've just picked up seems to have visual EDS markings on it. EDS is an alta formation focused on protecting altas from all possible threats, and thus all related items and objects often reflect that goal in their characteristics.  
Unfortunately, it seems like EDS's automated defence system went out of control recently, so I'd suggest avoiding contact with still active facilities.
- Seems like you've acquired an Alta Robotic, or simply a Drone Spawner. You can activate it to deploy a friendly drone (or droid). Unfortunately, you won't be able to further control it or deactivate it back.

## Parameters

### Drone Spawner

Constantly spawns <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/spawners/drones/mini.png" alt="Minidrone icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [minidrones](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/Minidrone) when aggroed. Will turn into [empty frigate drone](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/emptyfrigatedrone) on low health by releasing a [defensive drone](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/defensivedrone).  
It's hard to imagine all these tiny drones are being constructed on the fly.

### EDS Drone

Has status effects: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/stats/effects/ct_sensitive_electronics.png" alt="Sensitive Electronics icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [Sensitive Electronics](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/SensitiveElectronics), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/stats/effects/ct_autoeffect/ct_autoshielder_eds.png" alt="EDS Autoshielder icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [EDS Autoshielder](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDSAutoshielder), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/stats/effects/ct_eds_rocket_aimbot.png" alt="EDS Rocket Aimbot icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"> [EDS Rocket Aimbot](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/EDSRocketAimbot).
