- Alta: A security spike. These can sting quite a bit, better to not touch them when they're active.
- Apex: Electric traps. I'd better not touch.
- Avian: If only I could fly over these traps.
- Floran: Floran dislikess lightning machines.
- Glitch: Fearful. There appears to be enough current here to entirely fry my circuits.
- Human: Uh oh, looks dangerous.
- Hylotl: Similar devices are used defensively beneath the ocean. The Hylotl build moats of electricity currents as intruder deterrents.
- Novakid: I don't fancy getting a nasty jolt. Better steer clear.
