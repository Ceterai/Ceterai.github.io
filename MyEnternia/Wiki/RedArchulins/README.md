<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/assetMissing.png" alt="Red Archulins icon" loading="lazy" height="16px" width="auto" /> **Red Archulins** is a common dish.

A rare sort of [archulins](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/archulins) that is much smaller than usual, and is perfectly safe to eat as it is. Enjoy!  
These often grow in bigger groups than basic archulins, but are pretty difficult to find due to strict reuirements to the environment.

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Are these... safe? No bitterness, just sweet and sour? Nice!

Radiomessages on pickup:

- Beware of the warped items you just acquired. Warped is a form of wild growth found mainly on alterash planets, that tends to spread uncontrollably and contaminate everything in its path.  
Warped things can be bioluminescent, but they also tend to be quite venomous too. I wouldn't recommend testing your luck.
