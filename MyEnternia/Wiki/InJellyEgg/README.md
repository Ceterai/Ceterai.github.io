Can be used to spawn a jelly called [in jelly](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/injelly), or a "cave" jelly in alkey.  
These "eggs" are really just highly incubated versions of creatures, used by altas during research, often for simulation purposes, which is why they tend to be friendly to their owner.
