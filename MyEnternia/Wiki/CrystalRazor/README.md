A combat tool created as an art piece by an unknown Faradea Legend.  
Perhaps this is what led to the creation of all of the prototypes. Seems like calline crystals might have some hidden extraordinary features...

An upgrade for <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/weapons/melee/alta/heavy/ct_crystalline_sword.png" alt="Crystalline Sword icon" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="16px"/> [Crystalline Sword](https://ceterai.github.io/MyEnternia/Wiki/CrystallineSword).

## Ingame

Species descriptions:

- Alta: Doesn't seem to be a registered alta product. Maybe it's a semi-fresh prototype of sorts. Judging by its looks, that seems highly probable.

Radiomessages on pickup:

- You've just picked up an alta weapon, or an "energy tool", as they call it. According to my database, these usually have an extended set of features. I suggest reading its description.

## Parameters

### Sinara's Blade

A sequence of 4 (+1) heavy strikes. Hold to perform a Super Spin Slash.  
This refined, almost razor-sharp blade spins in your hand, creating a light show with its reflective surface, signing off in a dance of destruction.

### Sinara's Blast

Hold to perform a Blink Explosion.  
This abrupt release of energy leads to an even more effective result.
