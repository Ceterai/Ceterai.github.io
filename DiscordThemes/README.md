# Discord Themes

A place for the base files used by my BetterDiscord themes.

## Files

These are source files used as a **base** for the discord themes.

- [`base.css`](base.css) - the base file with all the style work.
- [`main.css`](main.css) - the stylesheet that should be imported by the theme file.
